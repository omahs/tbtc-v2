/// @title Bridge fraud
/// @notice The library handles the logic for challenging Bridge wallets that
///         committed fraud.
/// @dev Anyone can submit a fraud challenge indicating that a UTXO being under
///      the wallet control was unlocked by the wallet but was not used
///      according to the protocol rules. That means the wallet signed
///      a transaction input pointing to that UTXO and there is a unique
///      sighash and signature pair associated with that input.
///
///      In order to defeat the challenge, the same wallet public key and
///      signature must be provided as were used to calculate the sighash during
///      the challenge. The wallet provides the preimage which produces sighash
///      used to generate the ECDSA signature that is the subject of the fraud
///      claim. The fraud challenge defeat attempt will only succeed if the
///      inputs in the preimage are considered honestly spent by the wallet.
///      Therefore the transaction spending the UTXO must be proven in the
///      Bridge before a challenge defeat is called.
